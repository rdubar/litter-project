"""
Partick Litter Plan is a student project for a University design course.

It seeks to raise awareness of litter in the Partick area of Glasgow, Scotland, and encourage local residents to take action to keep their community clean.

It's designed to be easily used as a base for campaigns in other areas, with a focus on community engagement and education.

Remember: chatbots are not real people, and the information they provide may not always be accurate. Details are subject to change. Always verify information from official sources. 

Special thanks to my colleagues at APV for their support and encouragement.
