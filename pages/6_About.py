"""
Partick Litter Plan is a student project for a University design course.

I wanted to create a simple, accessible resource to help local communities tackle litter problems.

I hope to encourage people to take action to keep their community clean.

If you'd like to use any of these resources in your own communty I would love to hear from you.

Remember: *chatbots are not real people, and the information they provide may not always be accurate. Details are subject to change. Always verify information from official sources.* 

Special thanks to my colleagues at APV for their support and encouragement.
